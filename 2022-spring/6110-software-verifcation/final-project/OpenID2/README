In order to build Murphi3.1 locally (recommended), execute the following:

    > cd Murphi3.1/src
    > make && make install
    > cd ../..

Though our version of Murphi will build on any leland systems,
symmetry reduction appears not to be supported on 64-bit
machines.  In practice, therefore, the MYTH machines are best.

In the top-level project directory, type

    > make
    > ./ns -ndl -tv -m 1024

to build the model-checker and run the search.  Type

    > make clean

before re-making, if ns.m has changed.

To typeset our report paper, simply type

    > make report

The generated paper will be named report.pdf.  Our final slides
are contained in the file final_slides.pdf.
